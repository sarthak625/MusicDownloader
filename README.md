# Music Downloader

An app where you provide a list of songs, and all of them are downloaded in your device.

# Notes

# Day 1

- I was roaming in my terrace listening to songs on spotify, but the internet here is really bad. I was
thinking maybe i should download songs when i get back to my room using the wifi, but i dont want to search every song and go through those annoying ads and download each one of them. This is why i have decided to create this project.
- I am thinking of downloading songs from www.pagalworld.live and probably Amazon music
- Amazon Music will likely have their APIs, so it might be easy to download from there. 
- I will try to scrape pagalworld using cheerio
- I want this to be a web app so I can integrate it with my resume website when i create one.
- I have completed the logic of scraping pagalworld to get the download links to my songs. Tommorrow, i will add the logic of some other website.
